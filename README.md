Hello 👋🏼 , I’m Amr Yousry

I’m a .NET Full Stack Software Engineer with a passion for building highly functional and user friendly applications. My interest in software development started from my passion of Forex Trading. As a trader, I learned that trading platforms are missing simple features that I would have loved to have. The idea of missing out on trades due to the lack of functionality in trading platforms gave me the motivation to pursue a career in Software Engineering. Throughout my journey, I enjoyed taking on challenges of building full solutions to meet a specific goal. I'm always seeking new opportunites to learn if you think we can collaborate please reach me on one of the links below:
